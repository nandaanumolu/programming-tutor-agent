# Programming Tutor Agent

## Overview

This project contains an AI agent built with the ADK (Agent Development Kit) designed to act as a personal programming language tutor. The agent can help users learn any programming language by providing explanations, code examples, and answering questions.

## Features

-   **Interactive Tutoring:** The agent engages in a conversation to teach programming concepts.
-   **Multi-language Support:** Can teach a wide variety of programming languages.
-   **Code Generation:** Generates and saves code examples to the local filesystem for users to run and experiment with.
-   **Personalized Learning:** Adapts to the user's skill level.

## How to Run the Agent

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Agent:**
    Use the ADK command-line interface (CLI) to run the agent.
    ```bash
    adk run
    ```

3.  **Interact with the Agent:**
    Once the agent is running, you can start a conversation. For example:
    "I want to learn Python."
    "Can you give me a simple 'Hello, World!' example in JavaScript?"
